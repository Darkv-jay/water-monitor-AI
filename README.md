Our goal is to build a machine learning algorithm that can detect contamination images in real time, this way we can build your own AI based contamination classification device.
1. Introduction

In years to come, water, the need of life, is possibly to pose greatest challenge on account
of its increased demand with population rise, economic development, and shrinking
supplies due to over exploitation and pollution. In India, with development, the demand of
water is increasing both in urban and rural areas. This may create increased tension and
dispute between these areas for sharing and command of water resources. The emerging
scarcity of water has also raised a host of issues related to sustainability of present kind of
economic development, sustanious water supply, equity and social justice, water financing,
pricing, governance and management. The present paper explores the quantity of water
used in domestic households vis-Ã -vis the recommended quantity of water consumption in
seven major Indian cities, namely, Delhi, Kanpur, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Mumbai,
Hyderabad and Madurai. The paper also attempts to find out equity in consumption of
water across various socio-economic groups, sources of water supply, perception of
households about quality of municipal water, and duration of municipal water supply. The
organization of the rest of the study is as follows. Section II deals with methods used for
data collection and analysis, while Section III discusses the recommendations of various
agencies about the per capita need of water in urban areas. Results and discussions are
presented in Section IV, and the last Section presents summary and conclusions of the
study

2. Materials and Methods

The household survey, to find out the consumption, availability, access and methods
adopted for conservation of water in domestic households in seven major Indian cities,
Delhi, Gr. Mumbai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Kanpur, Ahmedabad and Madurai, was
conducted in March 2005. As per the Census of India 2001, these cities, except Madurai
(Municipal Corporation) are among 27 municipal corporations with million plus
population, and their respective populations are 9.8, 11.9, 4.6, 3.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 0.92
millions, respectively. The number of sample households selected from each of these cities 
was 507 in Delhi, 500 in Mumbai, 400 in Kolkata, 398 in Hyderabad, 303 in Kanpur, 361
in Ahmedabad, and 265 in Madurai. Thus, total 2,734 households were interviewed in
these seven cities. Each of these cities were categorized in five different areas, (i) high
income group (HIG) areas with well planned buildings, (ii) middle income group (MIG)
areas with well planned buildings, (iii) low income group (LIG) areas with well planned
buildings, (iv) slum areas, and (v) the mixed areas. Within these identified clusters,
random sampling of households from electoral role was done. In each of these cities,
several clusters of the same kinds of areas can be found, and therefore, from each cluster at
least 8 interviews were conducted. The data was collected through a structured schedule
and target respondents were the housewives. The volume of vessels in which households
used to store water was measured and the number of vessels of water used in different
activities was ascertained. Where running tap or piped water was used in some activities,
the duration for which the tap remained open was arrived at and the quantity of water per
minute coming out from the tap was measured. By multiplying the time with the quantity
of water per minute, the amount of water used through running taps was arrived at. The
amount of water used in toilet was assessed by volume of bucket used, and flush tank
capacity. The assessment of quantity of water used in various activities was a difficult
task, but all the efforts were put in to assure the accuracy of data. 

 A Deterministic Relationship between Water Availability, Health,
 Educational Attainments and Earnings.

The importance of supply/availability of clean water in economic and health spheres has
been the main motivating factor for the present study. It is estimates that about 70% of
diseases in human being are due to consumption of uncleaned water. The access to water
also has huge cost on educational attainments and incomes of individuals/households.
 a large share of population from the poorer section of the society (both in rural and urban
areas) loses their precious time collecting water for their daily needs. This deprives them
from daily wages crucial for their economic sustenance (see Fig.1). Further, recurring
health expenditures due to consumption of uncleaned water and low wages due to lower
skills keep them in vicious circle of poverty. While education helps to improve their
earnings, the health expenditures and loss of time/wages due to illness keep them in
poverty and penury (see Fig.2). Clean, adequate and regular water supply, therefore, are
extremely important in countries like South Asia, more so in India where a large section of
population lives in poverty and consumes uncleaned water, to help sizeable proportion of
the population move above poverty line. 

The Making and Unmaking of Poverty

our Hounrable prime minister started a theme SABKA SATH SABKA VIKAS. under in this  theme i started a project to innovate this theme.
in today's time there are 70% water is conatminated and need to be filtered by RO'S and by other purification systems.
those pepople are liviing on slum areas below the line of poverty level and other labours like the ricksahw drivers workwers of factories they can't afford the bissleries bottle and other water filtering machine....so our aim of this project is making water clean and locting the contamination of water area wise automatically by detecting the bacterias present in the water we can stop the 60% illness caused by the contaminated water. And through by this project we can assure to the people now the water is 100% contamination free 100% safe to use without any filtering process....through by this now all the peoples labours and workers can drink water by opening tap located anywhere.
