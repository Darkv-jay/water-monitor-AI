our Hounrable prime minister started a theme SABKA SATH SABKA VIKAS. 
Under in this theme i started a project to innovate this theme.
in today's time almost 70% water is conatminated and need to be filtered by RO'S or by other purification systems.
Those pepople who are liviing  in slum areas or blow poverty line, can not afford bissleri water bottles. 
Peoples who are Below then line of poverty level they can't afford the Bissleries bottle and other water filtering machine....so our aim of this project is making water clean and locating the contamination of water area wise automatically by detecting the bacterias present in the water. Through this process we can prevent overall 80% of illness caused by the contaminated water and we assure people to drink 100% contaminated free and safe water without any filtering charges or amount.
Through this project we can reduce the usage of plastic water drinking botteles bottles by oppening filtered water tap which should be located at public places like in earilier time we have handpump whuch are also dimnished into underground contaminated water And through by this project we can assure to the people now the water is 100% contamination free 100% safe to use without any filtering process....through by this now all the peoples labours and workers can drink water by opening tap located anywhere.
